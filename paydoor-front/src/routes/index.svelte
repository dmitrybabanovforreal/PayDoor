<p class="m-8">Imagine: you clicked an article somewhere, and there is a paywall.
    You'll probably never visit this website again. But they need to make money, right?</p>

<p class="m-8">Wouldn't it be cool to pay them let's say $0.25 to read this
    article only? With one click? No sign up forms, no email verification?</p>
<p class="m-8">With PayDoor, you only need one subscription to get behind any
    paywall. You open an article, see the paywall, click <b>"Open with PayDoor"</b> and
    read that article only. The payment is sent to them from your PayDoor account.</p>

<p class="m-8">Support local news outlets! People tend to subscribe to large news websites
    that already cover a broad range of topics.</p>
<p class="m-8">With PayDoor, a local news website has a chance to get paid too. Because if
    they publish a viral story and suddenly receive a ton of random visitors, those could
    pay them for their hard work with just one click and enjoy the piece.</p>

<p class="m-8">When you out of town and you come to a restaurant you see the first time
    to have a lunch, do they ask you to sign up for a monthly subscription to eat there?
    No, you hand over your credit card and your bank account is charged with the
    bill amount.</p>
<p class="m-8">It has to be equally easy with websites. If there is a paywall,
    there should be PayDoor.</p>
