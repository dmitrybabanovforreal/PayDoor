<div>
    <p>Hit another paywall on an article you saw on Facebook. They demand subscription to read it although you'll
        probably never visit this local news site again. But what can they do, they wanna make money too.</p>
    <p>Wouldn't it be cool to pay them once to read this article only? With one click? No forms, no email
        verification?</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>With PayDoor, you only need one subscription. You open an article, see the paywall, click "Open with
        PayDoor" and read that article only. Payment is sent to them from your PayDoor account.</p>

    <p>Support local news outlets. People tend to subscribe to large news websites that cover a broad range of
        topics. With PayDoor, a local news website has a chance to get paid for their hard work too when they
        publish a viral story.</p>

        important update on the progress.</p>
